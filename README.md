# AI Web Summarizer

A powerful browser extension that uses advanced AI models to instantly summarize webpages, articles, and documents. Save time by extracting key insights from long content with a single click.

**Available for Firefox (Manifest V2) and Chrome (Manifest V3)** - Each browser has its own optimized version in dedicated folders.

> **A Note from the Author:** This is vibe coded. I asked Claude to give me a list of AI summarizers, and instead of providing a list, it created an earlier version of this extension. I kind of took it from there. The extension now has all the features I wanted, including full TTS controls with speed and voice selection. It works well for my needs!
