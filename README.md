### **Firefox AI Web Summarizer**

Word of warning: This is vibe coded. I asked Claude to give me a list of AI summarizer, and instead of providing me with a list, it created an earlier version of this exension. I kind of took it from there. I will not further enhance this exension, as it has all the points i wanted. It could use some refining for the speech synthesis, like speed and voice selection.
